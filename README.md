# Learning App

## Overview

The Learning App is designed to help users manage their learning goals and track their daily progress. Built with Swift and SwiftUI using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, this app provides a user-friendly interface for logging learning activities and managing freeze days. Users can easily set their learning objectives, log their progress, and visualize their learning streaks.

## Features

- **User Input:** Users can specify their learning goals and duration (week, month, year).
- **Daily Logging:** Track daily learning activities with the ability to log progress.
- **Freeze Days:** Users can freeze learning days, which prevents them from being counted against their progress.
- **Progress Visualization:** The app visually displays logged days and frozen days using a calendar-like interface.
- **Dynamic User Interface:** A clean and responsive design built with SwiftUI.

## Architecture

The app is structured using the MVVM design pattern:

- **Model:** Contains the data structures and logic, including user preferences and learning status.
- **ViewModel:** Handles business logic and interacts with the Model to update the View. It manages state and binds data to the UI.
- **View:** Represents the UI of the app, composed of SwiftUI Views that respond to user input and display data.
